**Sentiment Analysis**: computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine the writer's attitude towards a particular topic

Reviews are a good way to explore sentiment and text understanding.

Scherer Typology of Affective States:

- Emotion, brief feeling
- Mood, low intensity and long duration
- Interpersonal, stance toward another person
- Attitude, enduring beliefs towards objects or persons
- Personality traits, stable dispositions and typical behavior

Sentiment analysis detects **attitudes**.

- Holder (source) of attitude
- Target (aspect) of attitude
- Type of attitude (like, love, hate, value, desire, etc. or more simply a weighted polarity of good or bad)
- Text containing attitude

Kinds of Sentiment Analysis:

- Polarity task, is attitude positive, negative, or neutral?
- Subjectivity vs objectivity task, phrases that are influenced and not influenced by attitude
- Feature/aspect task, associate attitude with a particular aspect (price, ease of use, setup, etc.)
- Contextual task, detect source of attitude

Removing nonsubjective phrases can improve the accuracy of a polarity classifier.

**Sentiment Lexicons** assign general sentiment to words outside of context. Some examples are: General Inquirer, LIWC, MPQA, Bing Liu Opinion Lexicon, SentiWordNet. There is a wide range of dissagreement between these lexicons.
