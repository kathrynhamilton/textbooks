## One - The Emotional Craft of Fiction

Writers often ask where the balance is between showing and telling. What is the best way to get across what the character is going through?

This is not the most useful question. Instead, as all readers will read a book differently, **we want to ask how to get readers to go on an emotional journey of their own**.

This emotional journey is not created through simply showing or telling. It also involves elements like plot, setting, mood, and dialogue.

This book focuses on ways of creating a powerful experience for readers as they read.

Too often does good writing produce little feeling. **Great classics have an enduring appeal not for the art but for the impact. We remember the experiences we had when we read them.**

## Two - Inner versus Outer

There are three ways to produce an emotional response in readers:

1. *Inner Mode* - report what characters are feeling so effectively that readers feel something too (telling)
2. *Outer Mode* - provoke in readers what characters may be feeling by implying their inner state through external action (showing)
3. *Other Mode* - cause readers to feel something that a story's characters do no themselves feel

Each way has its benefits and drawbacks. We must understand why each is effective in order to use it properly.

### Outer Mode

The choice between *inner* and *outer modes* is very important. Often, the genre might dictate this choice, for example romance tends to rely on inner mode and thrillers tend to rely on *outer mode*.

When outward actions elicit emotion, **it is not the actions that have stirred us but something we have stirred ourselves: a realization, a hint at a greater statement, fact, event, or emotion transpiring**.

*Outer mode* can be useful when the inner emotions of a character are particularly dark and painful. Just as humor creates a safety zone for discussing heavy topics, pulling out of the inner world and into **the *outer* world can help readers digest things at a safe distance**.

**A secret ingredient to effective showing is *subtext*: when there is a feeling that is not being told but is evident anyway**. It might keep readers wondering about what theya ren't ebing told, or helps them see a larger theme or truth. Small doeses of subtext sum to a large effect.

**To use *outer mode*, find what gave you the emotion, the action that caused the excitement.** Write it down, making it clear so the reader will see it and feel what you did too.

**Readers only like to pick up baggage when it is heavily emotional**. This means either discussing a heavy concept directly, or by alluding to it indirectly through a more mundane action or metaphor.

***Outer mode* can be be a very effective lead up to *inner mode***. First grip the audience with an earlier, unspoken emotion, before stating an emotion directly and plainly.

**Steps to effective showing**:

1. Select a moment when the protagonist is moved, unsettled, or disturbed.
2. Write down all the emotions inherent in this moment, both obvious and hidden.
3. Write down how the protagonist can act it out. What is the biggest, loudest, most explosive, most offensive, most out-of-bounds thing they can do? What could they say to cut right to the chase. How can they show us a feeling we don't expect to see?
4. Add a detail of the setting that only the protagonist would notice, or that everyone notices but the protagonist sees in a unique way.
5. Go back and delete all the emotions that you wrote down. Let the actions do the work. Does it sound over-the-top? Use it anyway; most likely you haven't gone far enough.
