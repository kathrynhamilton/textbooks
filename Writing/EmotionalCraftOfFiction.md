## One - The Emotional Craft of Fiction

Writers often ask where the balance is between showing and telling. What is the best way to get across what the character is going through?

This is not the most useful question. Instead, as all readers will read a book differently, we want to ask *how to get readers to go on an emotional journey of their own*.

This emotional journey is not created through simply showing or telling. It also involves elements like plot, setting, mood, and dialogue.

This book focusses on ways of creating a powerful experience for readers as they read.

Too often does good writing produce little feeling. Great classics have an enduring appeal not for the art but for the impact. We remember the experiences we had when we read them.
