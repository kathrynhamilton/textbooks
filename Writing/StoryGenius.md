### Introduction

What's the biggest mistakes writers make? The don't know what a story is. Most writers mistake story for the things we can see on the page: the stunning prose, the authoritative voice, the intense and exciting plot, the clever structure. It's not.

Story flows directly from how the protagonist is making sense of what's happening, how they struggle with, evalute, and weigh what matters most to *to them*, and then make hard decisions, moving the action forward. Story is about how the things that happen in the plot *affect* the protagonist, and how they change internally as a result. Story is about an internal struggle, not an external one.

This is why you have to know everything there is to know about ther protagonist's specific internal problem *before* you create the plot. Story first, plot second.

## Part One - What a Story Is, and What It Isn't

### Chapter 1 - The Brain's Decoder Ring

Humans are wired for story, regardless of the genre. When you read a book, it's as if someone pressed the pause button on your own life, allowing you to love and breathe in an alternate reality. An effective story is an offer your brain can't refuse.

Getting lost in a story could be deadly, which is why scientists figured there had to be a damn good reason for it. They found that story was, in a sense, the world's first virtual reality. Stories let us vicariously try out difficult situations we haven't yet experiences to see what it would *really* feel like, and what we'd need to learn in order to survive.

We've mistaken the feeling story gives us - that deliciously seductive pleasure - for its purpose. Stories feel good for the same reason food tastes good: we wouldn't survive without it. Food nourishes us, stories educate us. Reading a good story causes your brain to release dopamine, which is its way of rewarding you for following your curiosity to find out how the story ends because you might learn something you need to know.

When you read a story, your brain activity isn't that of an observer but of a participant. Our brain registers an effective story in the same way thaty it does things that occur out here in the real world.

As we've grown as a species, story has evolved too. It now teaches us not only what we need to survive, but also what we need to prosper. Our brains want stories that expand out social coginitive skills, that teach us how to work together and understand other people.

Stories help us interpret and anticipate the actions of ourselves and others. We turn to story to navigate reality rather than escape it. We don't turn to stories for the beautiful language, poetic writing, or dramatic plot points. We come because we want inside information on how to survive in the glorious, cruel, beautiful world, and in style no less.

So to write an effective story, we need to teach the reader how to face certain obstacles in life. We need to warn them about what they might feel, and how best to deal with themselves and others in that case. In a nutshell, we need to show them how things that happen affect someone in pursuit of a difficult goal, and how that person changes internally as a result.

### Chapter 2 - Myths Galore: Everything We Were Taught About Writing is Wrong

From kindergarten, we are taught: become a wordsmith and you automatically become a story teller. We are taught that writing well means coming up with great characters, interesting situations, dramatic scenes, compelling dialogue, gorgeous metaphors, beautiful sentances, and plenty of sensory details because that's what brings a story to life. But if this is true, then how can series like *Fifty Shades of Grey* sell over 100 million copies?

It turns out that good writing is the handmaiden of story, not the other way around. Of the two, only story is essential.

Writing blindly into the dark (pantsing) is a recipe for disaster, because there is no guarantee of context. Context is what bestows meaning and defines what matters, what doesn't, and why. It is better to first harness creativity to the past from which the story arises rather than unleashing it freely onto the keyboard.

First drafts are meant to be shitty, but in no circumstance should you be able to massage what you have written to produce a better story by moving things around. The very fact that you *can* move things around is a sign that the novel has no internal logic.

Plotting a story before writing is is the way to go but many, many writers fail because they focus on developing the external plot rather than the internal story. They focus on "what" rather than "why". Plotters have it backwards. The events in the plot must be created to force the protagonist to make a *specific* really hard internal change. This means you need to know *specifically* what that change will be before creating a plot.

You can't have an after without a before, You can't write about how someone changes unless you know what they're changing from. They story doesn't start on page one. It started long before you got there. This doesn't mean you can solve your problems by simply dropping your protagonist into action and explaining it later. This means what starts on page one is the *second* half of the story, and whil contain large parts of the first in the form of flashbacks, dialogue, and snippets of memory. Without the first half of the story, there can be no second half. 

## Part Two - Creating the Inside Story

### Chapter 3 - The What If? Expectation, Broken!

##### 1. The First Pinprick

In no more than one page, write about the instant the idea that you're working with - the one that won't seem to leave you alone - first grabbed you.

##### 2. Why do you care?

In no more than a page, write down why you care about the story that you want to tell. There is not right answer; whatever comes to mind is relevant - even if it seems silly. You might surprise yourself and discover you care for an entirely different reason than you thought you did.

##### 3. What's your point?

See if you can nail down the point your story will make in a few concise lines. What do you want your readers to go away thinking about? What are you trying to say about human nature that will help us keep from getting trounced in the future?

##### 4. Drafting your What If

Write a What If that's as fully fleshed out as you can make it, but still concise. Keep at it until you have something specific, with context, conflict and a hint of surprise.

### Chapter 4 - The Who: Whose Life Will You Utterly Upend?

Write a thumbnail sketch of who your protagonist is before the novel starts. Who is this person on the inside? What do they believe? What do they want? Where are they in life, specifically?

### Chapter 5 - The Why: Why, Exactly, Does Your Protagonist Care?

All protagonists stand on the threshold of the novel they're about to be flung into with two things about to burn a hole in their pocket:

* A deep-seated desire - something they've wanted for a very long time
* A defining misbelief that stands in the way of achieving that desire. This is where the fear that's holding the back comes from

##### 1. What does your protagonist already want?

Write a short paragraph about what your character enters the novel wanting, even if they don't think they have a chance in hell of getting it. Use the "eyes shut" test - if you can't close your eyes and envision it, it's not there yet.

##### 2. Why do they want it? What does it mean to them?

Write about why your protagonist whats that they want. What will getting it mean to them? What do they think it will say about them? To the outside world, it might say something quite different. Often, what your protagonist thinks achieving their goal will mean turns out to be very wrong.

##### 3. Misbelief? But if feels so true!

Try defining your protagonist's misbelief, the thing that is stopping them from getting what they want. What do they want, and what is the fear that is keeping them from achieving it? What do they think the very worst think that could happen would be?

### Chapter 6 - The Worldview: Your Protagonist's, That Is

##### 1. Finding the Origin Scene

Can you envision the moment in your protagonist's life when their misbelief took root? Every character filters the world through their own internal logic, based on what the events in their past forces them to face. The goal is to find that defining moment in their past.

##### 2. The Before

Before you begin writing any scene, you need to answer four questions:

* What does my protagonist go into the scene believing?
* Why does she believe it?
* What is my protagonist's goal in the scene?
* What does my protagonist expect will happen in this scene?

Jot down your answers to each of the four questions.

##### 3. Writing the Origin Scene

Capture the moment when your protagonist's wold view shifted and their misbelief took root in their brain. Write a full fledged scene and do it in first person to unlock the emotional, mental journey specifically.

### Chapter 7 - The What Next? The Beauty of Cause and Effect

If you're not giving your reader a clear, plausible cause-and-effect progression, illuminated by the why behind it, then you're not giving them a story they can follow or care about. If your scenes can be linked with "and then", rather than "therefore" or "but", then you have something quite boring. The protagonist's past is a big part of the novel's opposition.

##### 1. Zero in on three turning point scenes that will yield the most story-specific info, the most important grist for the mill. 

They should be moments that helped create, perpetuate, and escalate the problem your protagonist will be forced to deal with when your novel starts. Make it a moment in their life where their misbelief was the deciding factor in a major decision that they made and ultimately kept them from fulfilling their deepest desire.

##### 2. Write each scene in chronological order. Aim for scenes as fully fleshed out as the Origin Scene.

They don't have to be polished or beautifully written. They just have to capture the escalating turning points in your protagonist's life.

The story-specific cause-and-effect trajectory began in the Origin Scene and continues with these three (or more) scenes.

### Chapter 8 - The When: An Offer Your Protagonist Can't Refuse (But Probably Wants To)

The novel should start when life will no longer allow your protagonist to put off going after that thing they've always wanted, regardless of how much their misbelief suggests they sit this one out.

What unavoidable external change will catapult the protagonist into the fray, triggering their internal battle?

##### 1. Do a little free writing about your intended plot. Extract from that a list of as many ideas for your novel's main problem as possible, even the ones that seem far-fetched.

##### 2. Look through each possibility and ask yourself: can the problem sustain the entire novel from the first page to the last (external test)?

* Can the problem build? 
* Is there a real-world specific, impending consequence that this escalating problem will give the protagonist no choice but to face? 
* Is there a clear-cut deadline, a ticking clock counting down to that consequence?

##### 3. Look through the remaining possibilities and ask yourself: is the problem capable of forcing your protagonist to make the inner change that your novel is actually about (internal test)?

* Will the problem's impending consequence force the protagonist to struggle with their misbelief?
* Regardless of whether or not the protagonist achieves their goal, will the approaching consequence cost them something big, emotionally speaking (ie. shatter the protagonist's worldview once and for all)?
 
Keep at it until you have developed one overarching plot problem that leaps over every hurdle and meets both tests. This will probably be a combination of some of the original problems you came up with.

##### 4. Sketch out the ticks that will lead up to your opening scene. Find the tick that catapults your protagonist into unavoidable action.

It is typically around the sixth or seventh tick, and will be when your protagonist must act and must act now.

Congratulations! You not only know when your novel starts but you also know why, what's at stake, what it means to your protagonist, and what your novel is about.
