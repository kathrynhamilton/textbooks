## Part Two - Creating the Inside Story

### Chapter 3 - The What If?

##### 1. The First Pinprick

In no more than one page, write about the instant the idea that you're working with---the one that won't seem to leave you alone---first grabbed you.

##### 2. Why do you care?

In no more than a page, write down why you care about the story that you want to tell. There is not right answer; whatever comes to mind is relevant---even if it seems silly. You might surprise yourself and discover you care for an entirely different reason than you thought you did.

##### 3. What's your point?

See if you can nail down the point your story will make in a few concise lines. What do you want your readers to go away thinking about? What are you trying to say about human nature that will help us keep from getting trounced in the future?

##### 4. Drafting your What If

Write a What If that's as fully fleshed out as you can make it, but still concise. Keep at it until you have something specific, with context, conflict and a hint of surprise.

### Chapter 4 - The Who?

Write a thumbnail sketch of who your protagonist is before the novel starts. Who is this person on the inside? What do they believe? What do they want? Where are they in life, specifically?

### Chapter 5 - The Why?

All protagonists stand on the threshold of the novel they're about to be flung into with two things about to burn a hole in their pocket:

* A deep-seated desire---something they've wanted for a very long time
* A defining misbelief that stands in the way of achieving that desire. This is where the fear that's holding the back comes from

##### 1. What does your protagonist already want?

Write a short paragraph about what your character enters the novel wanting, even if they don't think they have a chance in hell of getting it. Use the "eyes shut" test---if you can't close your eyes and envision it, it's not there yet.

##### 2. Why do they want it? What does it mean to them?

Write about why your protagonist whats that they want. What will getting it mean to them? What do they think it will say about them? To the outside world, it might say something quite different. Often, what your protagonist thinks achieving their goal will mean turns out to be very wrong.

##### 3. Misbelief? But if feels so true!

Try defining your protagonist's misbelief, the thing that is stopping them from getting what they want. What do they want, and what is the fear that is keeping them from achieving it? What do they think the very worst think that could happen would be?

### Chapter 6 - The Worldview

##### 1. Finding the Origin Scene

Can you envision the moment in your protagonist's life when their misbelief took root? Every character filters the world through their own internal logic, based on what the events in their past forces them to face. The goal is to find that defining moment in their past.

##### 2. The Before

Before you begin writing any scene, you need to answer four questions:

* What does my protagonist go into the scene believing?
* Why does she believe it?
* What is my protagonist's goal in the scene?
* What does my protagonist expect will happen in this scene?

Jot down your answers to each of the four questions.

##### 3. Writing the Origin Scene

Capture the moment when your protagonist's wold view shifted and their misbelief took root in their brain. Write a full fledged scene and do it in first person to unlock the emotional, mental journey specifically.

### Chapter 7 - The What Next?

If you're not giving your reader a clear, plausible cause-and-effect progression, illuminated by the why behind it, then you're not giving them a story they can follow or care about. If your scenes can be linked with "and then", rather than "therefore" or "but", then you have something quite boring. The protagonist's past is a big part of the novel's opposition.

##### 1. Zero in on three turning point scenes that will yield the most story-specific info, the most important grist for the mill. They should be moments that helped create, perpetuate, and escalate the problem your protagonist will be forced to deal with when your novel starts. Make it a moment in their life where their misbelief was the deciding factor in a major decision that they made and ultimately kept them from fulfilling their deepest desire.

##### 2. Write each scene in chronological order. Aim for scenes as fully fleshed out as the Origin Scene. They don't have to be polished or beautifully written. They just have to capture the escalating turning points in your protagonist's life.

The story-specific cause-and-effect trajectory began in the Origin Scene and continues with these three (or more) scenes.

### Chapter 8 - The When?

The novel should start when life will no longer allow your protagonist to put off going after that thing they've always wanted, regardless of how much their misbelief suggests they sit this one out.

What unavoidable external change will catapult the protagonist into the fray, triggering their internal battle?

##### 1. Do a little free writing about your intended plot. Then extract from that a list of as many ideas for your novel's main problem as possible, even the ones that seem far-fetched.

##### 2. Look through each possibility and ask yourself: can the problem sustain the entire novel from the first page to the last (external test)?

* Can the problem build? 
* Is there a real-world specific, impending consequence that this escalating problem will give the protagonist no choice but to face? 
* Is there a clear-cut deadline, a ticking clock counting down to that consequence?

##### 3. Look through the remaining possibilities and ask yourself: is the problem capable of forcing your protagonist to make the inner change that your novel is actually about (internal test)?

* Will the problem's impending consequence force the protagonist to struggle with their misbelief?
* Regardless of whether or not the protagonist achieves their goal, will the approaching consequence cost them something big, emotionally speaking (ie. shatter the protagonist's worldview once and for all)?
 
Keep at it until you have developed one overarching plot problem that leaps over every hurdle and meets both tests. This will probably be a combination of some of the original problems you came up with.

##### 4. Sketch out the ticks that will lead up to your opening scene. Your goal is to find the tick that catapults your protagonist into unavoidable action. Your protagonist must act and must act now.

Congratulations! You not only know when your novel starts but you also know why, what's at stake, what it means to your protagonist, and what your novel is about.
